# Polycode

## Polycode is a project that consists of one application, remade across multiple languages.
### Its aim is to document the differences across these languages in terms of the following:
- Setup : 
  ` "Which of these applications was the easiest to get up and running, and how long would the average developer take to set it up" `
- Runtime: 
  `Which of these applications performs the task at hand the most efficiently, and how quiclky can it get it done `
- Syntax:
    `Which of these applications has the most readable code, and which of these applications has the most intuitive syntax`
- Community:
    `Which of these applications is written in a language with a large support system from the community, and how easy is it to get bugs and other things fixed `
- Documentation:
    `Which of these applications has the best documentation, and how easy is it to find the documentation for the application `
- Deployment:
  `Which of these applications is the easiest to deploy, and how easy is it to deploy the application to multiple platform?`


### The application that will be remade is a simple polls app, with CRUD features , it will be made in the following languages:
- Python
- Ruby 
- Javascript
- Ocaml
- C#
- Java

### The application will be made using the following frameworks:
- Django
- Ruby on rails
- React + Next
- Dream + Bonsai
- .Net 
- Springboot 

### The application will be deployed to the following platforms:
- Heroku
